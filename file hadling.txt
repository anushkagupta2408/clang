/*
file handling
=================
 to store data permanentaly in secondary storage device
 following tools are use to maninatain files in c:
 
 1.FILE pointer:
  --used to store an address of file stored in secondary memory
  syntax:
  FILE *p;
  
 2.fopen()
   --- this function is used to open afile in various modes
   
   w : this mode first create a  specified file & open it into write mode and 
       return the base addreess of file to file pointer 
       
   r : this mode first search the specified file in file exist it open it into
       read mode and return the base address of file pointer
	   
   a : appends the record at end of file 
   
   syntax
   =======
        <file pointer>=fopen("<filename>","<mode>");
		
		FILE *p;
		p=fopen("emp.db","w");          //create a new file for write
		p=fopen("emp.db","r");          //search a file for read
		p=fopen("emp.db","a");          //search a file and open for add something in the end
		
   3.fwrite()		
	 ---this function read data from (secondarymemory) and write into file 
	     RAM (primary memory)
	  
	  syntax
	  =======	 
		 fwrite(&<memory variable>,sizeof(memory variable>,n,<file pointer>)	
    
	4.fwrite()		
	 ---this function read data from RAM (primary memory) and write into file 
	    (secondary memory)
	  
	  syntax
	  =======	 
		 fread(&<memory variable>,sizeof(memory variable>,n,<file pointer>)	
		 
	5.int feof(<file pointer>)                //file end of file
	  ----return 1 at end of file return 0
	  	
example:
student
       roll no., name,p,c,m
       60-100 A
       48-59 B
       33-47 C
       0-33
